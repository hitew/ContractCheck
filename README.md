# ContractCheck



**ACCEPTED BY IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON SOFTWARE ENGINEERING**

---

## Project Description

This project aims to provide fine-grained vulnerabilities detection on smart contracts, including Integer Overflow/Underflow, Denial of Service, Authorization through tx.origin, and Time Manipulation (Block values as a proxy for time).

## Quick Start

Step 1: Pull the Docker Image
To start, you will need to pull the latest version of the contractcheck image from the Docker registry. This can be done with the following command:
bash

```
docker pull hitew/contractcheck:3.0
```

Step 2: Run the Docker Container
After successfully pulling the image, you can run a Docker container using the following command:

```
docker run -v /path/to/:/app/input.sol contractcheck:3.0
```

Replace /path/to/ with the path to the directory on your host system that contains the smart contract files (.sol) you wish to check.

## Vulnerability Detection Example

Contract URL: [dos_number.sol](https://github.com/SmartContractSecurity/SWC-registry/blob/master/test_cases/dos_gas_limit/dos_number.sol) or [input.sol](https://github.com/hitew/ContractCheck/blob/master/input.sol) 

Vulnerability Locations: 
```
Denial of Service vulnerability. lines: 18,19,20,22
```
### Detection Results
```
Code Slices generated by AST: ['[18, 23]', '[18, 18]', '[19, 21]', '[20, 20]', '[22, 22]', '[27, 27]', '[28, 28]', '[35, 35]', '[36, 36]', '[37, 37]', '[41, 41]', '[45, 45]']
*Code lines with Denial of Service : [18, 23]縲ー18, 18]縲ー19, 21]縲ー20, 20]縲ー22, 22]
```
Explanation

- Code lices generated by AST: ...
These slices are identified by their start and end lines in the source code, represented in the format [start line, end line] and derived from the AST.
- *Code lines with {vun_name}: ... 
- If no vulnerabilities are found, the report will simply state: Clean contract.
